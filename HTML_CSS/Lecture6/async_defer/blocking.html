<!-- 
async and defer are attributes used with the
<script> element in HTML to control how a script is executed.

async:
When you add the async attribute to a < script > tag, it means that the script will be executed asynchronously as soon as it is available, without blocking the HTML parsing.
The HTML parsing and rendering will continue, and the script will be executed whenever it's downloaded, without waiting for other scripts or resources.
    

Example:

    html
Copy code
        < script async src = "example.js" ></script>
defer:

When you add the defer attribute to a
<script> tag, it means that the script will be executed in order, after the HTML has been fully parsed.
Multiple scripts with the defer attribute will be executed in the order they appear in the document.
The HTML parsing doesn't wait for the script to be downloaded and will continue.
    Example:

    html
Copy code
        < script defer src = "example.js" ></script>
Comparison:

Both async and defer are used to improve the loading and execution of scripts, especially for large or complex web
pages.
The key difference is in when the script is executed:
With async, the script is executed as soon as it's available, potentially out of order.
With defer, the script is executed in order after the HTML has been parsed.
If order of execution matters and the script relies on the DOM being fully parsed, you should use defer. 
If the script
can be executed independently and doesn't rely on the DOM being fully available, you can use async.

If neither attribute is present, the script is downloaded and executed synchronously, blocking HTML parsing until it's
done.

Example combining both attributes (not recommended unless you have a specific use case):
html
Copy code
<script async defer src="example.js"></script>
In this case, the script will be downloaded asynchronously and executed in order when the HTML parsing is complete. -->
