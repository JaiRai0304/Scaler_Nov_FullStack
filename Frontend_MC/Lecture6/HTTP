HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) operates over the TCP/IP suite and uses a simple, text-based protocol for
communication between clients and servers. An HTTP packet, also referred to as an HTTP message, consists of two main
parts: the request and the response. Let's break down each:





HTTP Request Packet:
An HTTP request packet is sent from a client (e.g., a web browser) to a server to request a specific resource. It
consists of:

Request Line:

Contains the HTTP method, URL (Uniform Resource Locator), and HTTP version.
Example: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Headers:

Additional information about the request.
Examples: Host, User-Agent, Accept.
Empty Line:

Signifies the end of the headers.
Body (Optional):

Data sent to the server, often used in POST requests.

Example: Form data or JSON payload.


GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:97.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/97.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8

HTTP Response Packet:
An HTTP response packet is sent from the server to the client in response to an HTTP request. It consists of:

Status Line:

Contains the HTTP version, a three-digit status code, and a reason phrase.
Example: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Headers:

Additional information about the response.
Examples: Content-Type, Content-Length, Server.
Empty Line:

Signifies the end of the headers.
Body (Optional):

Data sent from the server to the client.

Example: HTML, JSON, or binary data.


Example HTTP Response Packet:
